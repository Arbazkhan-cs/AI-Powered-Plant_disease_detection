# Project Overview: AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection

<b>🌱 CNN Model Implementation:</b> In this project, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) serve as the cornerstone technology for developing the plant disease detection system. 
CNNs excel in image classification tasks by automatically learning features from raw pixel data, enabling the model to identify disease patterns in plant images effectively.

<b>🖼️ Image Preprocessing Techniques:</b> Extensive preprocessing steps have been employed to optimize dataset quality. Techniques such as resizing, normalization, 
and augmentation enhance dataset utility and standardization, ensuring that input data is well-suited for training the CNN model.

<b>📊 Dataset Sourcing from Kaggle:</b> The dataset used for training and evaluation has been sourced from Kaggle, a renowned platform for sharing datasets. 
This dataset likely comprises a diverse array of plant images annotated with disease labels, offering a rich foundation for training a robust and accurate disease detection model.
